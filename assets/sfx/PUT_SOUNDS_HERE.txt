Put your OWN sound files here (that you have the rights to use).

This build is now a social app, so you can add multiple variants too:

Examples:
- assets/sfx/like_1.mp3
- assets/sfx/like_2.mp3
- assets/sfx/notif_1.ogg
- assets/sfx/tab_1.wav

Legacy names still work:
- bubble, zap, horn, whoosh, slap, splat, laugh, success, error
