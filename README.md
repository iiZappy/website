A single-page (plus a games page) **meme-heavy** SQF / Arma-style mission editor parody.

Characters (original mascots):
- **Spingo** (yellow chaos sponge energy)
- **Jimbo** (boy-genius sci-fi energy)
- **Shronk** (green ogre energy)

Important:
- No copyrighted images/audio are shipped.
- All visuals are original SVG + CSS, all audio is procedural WebAudio.

Pages:
- `index.html` — “Eden-ish” editor parody UI with panels, viewport, console, sound, and easter eggs.
- `games.html` — mini meme games with sound.
