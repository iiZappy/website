# iiZappy/website

A single-page, meme-heavy, **professional-looking** Arma 3 scripting tutorial parody site.

Theme:
- It teaches SQF with 0% understanding and 200% confidence.
- Mascots: **Spingo**, **Jimbo**, **Shronk** (original, legally-distinct goofballs).

Features:
- Full "meme desktop" UI rework: draggable windows, sticker collage aesthetics.
- Lots of easter eggs + procedural WebAudio sound effects (no external assets).
- No tracking, no cookies, no data collection.

## Develop
Open `index.html` directly, or serve it locally.

## Deploy (GitHub Pages)
