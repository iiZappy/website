# iiZappy/website

A single-page, meme-heavy, **professional-looking** Arma 3 scripting tutorial parody site.

Theme:
- It teaches SQF “with absolute confidence and zero understanding”.
- Mascots: **Spingo** (definitely not a sponge), **Jimbo** (definitely not a boy genius), **Shronk** (definitely not an ogre).

Features:
- Smooth UI, responsive layout, accessible interactions.
- Lots of easter eggs + procedural WebAudio sound effects (no external assets).
- No tracking, no cookies, no data collection.

## Develop
Open `index.html` directly, or serve it locally.
